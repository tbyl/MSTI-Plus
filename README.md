# MSTI-Plus: A Comprehensive Multimodal Sarcasm Target Identification Benchmark


MSTI-Plus introduces a novel and comprehensive benchmark for **Multimodal Sarcasm Target Identification**, featuring fine-grained annotations on both sarcasm targets and normal non-sarcasm aspects. It is designed to help deep models better perceive the semantic differences between these elements and enhance interpretability in sarcasm detection systems.

## Dataset Overview

The MSTI-Plus dataset includes:
- **Multimodal Samples**: Pairs of images and text, each annotated with sarcasm-related labels.
- **Annotations**:
  - Sarcasm targets (textual and visual)
  - Non-sarcasm aspects
- **Visual Sarcasm Targets**: Labeled for interpretability rather than high-precision bounding boxes.
